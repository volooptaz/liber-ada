              Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies
              imagine that because the business of [Babbage's Analytical
              Engine] is to give its results in numerical notation, the nature
              of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and numerical,
              rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The
              engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly
              as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact
